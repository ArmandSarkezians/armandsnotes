    Hello, my name is Armand Sarkezians and I am currently a Computer Science specialist at the University of Toronto Scarborough, and an upincoming software
    engineer at Twitch. These are the notes that I have accumulated over my time at University of Toronto, as well as some other notes that I have taken
    over the years. I hope that you find them useful!
